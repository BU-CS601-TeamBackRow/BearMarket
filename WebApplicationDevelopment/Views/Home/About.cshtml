<h3>How BullMarket Analysis started...</h3>
<br />
    <h4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bull Market Analysis team met coincidentally through a Summer Web Application Development course taught at Boston University during 
    the summer of 2014. On the first day of class, Professor Raj Heda asked the class to carry out a get-to-know-your-neighbor game wherein
    each of the students were assigned to get to know someone sitting near them and subsequently introduce that person to the rest of the 
    class. Through that activity and several others, an unbreakable bond was formed between the four men of the back row.</h4> 
<br />    
    <h4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHours later, the BackRow Group was formed, dreams and aspirations shared, and the concept of the BullMarket Watch application took root.  Over the course
    of the semester, the BackRow Group experienced many ups and downs, but together they accomplished something great and wonderful, together
    they created a web-application that at least one person has called "the greatest market watch tool to ever be created".</h4>
